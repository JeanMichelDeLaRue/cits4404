# cits4404
Ant Colony Optimisation implementation for CITS4404

This repository provides an implementation of the Ant Colony Optimisation (ACO) metaheuristic for applications in Vehicle Routing. All source code is in ant.py. Tests are in test.py. 


### Prerequisites
The following packages are required to run ant.py:
```
Networkx
```							

To run the algorithm on established problems, we used Marius Solomon's Vehicle Routing Problem data sets, which can be found [here](http://w.cba.neu.edu/~msolomon/problems.htm)

### Installing
Running our implementation of the ACO does not require installation beyond the dependencies indicated above. 

### Tests
Runing the following command;
```
python -m unittest tests
```
should execute all tests. 

_This repository contains source code for partial fulfilment of  CITS4404 at the University of Western Australia (2017)._
